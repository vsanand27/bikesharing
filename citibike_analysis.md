## The purpose of this presentation is to evaluate investment proposal to develop ride-sharing Business in Des Monies, Iowa by performing the following tasks:

1) Review population of Des Moines vs. New York  

2) Understand affect of population on the bike-sharing program

3) Understand current ride sharing business in Deomines Iowa to recommend whether to consider the investment 

## Key Takeaways

1) Population of Des Moines is only 0.2M vs. 8.3M New York

2) Population density is 2,407 per square mile and is concentrated in small geographic area mostly downtown Des Moines, Iowa versus New York  where population density is 72,033 per square mile.  Due to desperse population in Des Moines, many local population may not prefer traveling with bike share due to long distances between places.

3) Due to Downtown cycling paths and trails, bike-share business is prevelant in Des Moines community.  However, the competition looks high resulting in deep discounts.  Avg. price tag per survey for 8hrs of bike share was $6 per survey results vs. $12 in New York.  Also, due to long distances between places, there will be more maintainence required with the result Return of Investment (ROI) nearly approaching to zero or negative. 

4) Median Household income in Des Moines is $38K vs. $121k in Manhattan.  Des Moines population may not have enough discreationary income to buy leisure items and sporting goods.  Manhattan population on the other hand have the income but also may need bike to get around density populated areas.

## Recommendation: 

Based on Population, we propose to not invest in the bikesharing business.  

The scope of this analysis is limited since we are not accounting for visitors to the city that create high demand for the bike share program.  Also, we are not accounting for seasonal trends, demographics and other trends that require further research.

## Population 

## 1. Population of Des Moines is very small only .2M vs. 8.4M New York. 

Reviewing 8 year population trends fromm 2010 - 2018, the population for Des Moines does not seem to be increasing at fast pace. In 2018 reported population for Des Moines was 216K vs. 204K in 2010, only a nominal increase of 5.8% over 8 years.   

Impact of low Population: Volume of bike sharing demand originating from Des Moines population may be limited despite bike friendly city and sorrounding trails.   The actual volume will come from tourist visiting.

## 2. Population Density

Per Wikipedia, Population Density of Des Moines only 2,407 people per Square Miles vs. 72,033 in Manhattan where the most bikeshare rides.  Even the sorrounding areas around manhattan had high density which ranged from 8K per square miles in Staton Island to 37K in Brooklyn, NY. 

Des Moines: Census Data show that area of density is concentrated around downtown where the population is $6K to 70K.  However populated area is smaller and sorrounding area show lower population density  ie. below 3K.  

Comparitively New York City: area is bigger and is navigable through out even with concentrated pocket of population density.  In-between glass and concrete structures are green spaces like central park which attracts millions of New Yorkers to utilize bike share.  In addition, New York density is high, therefore many prefer bicycle as mode of transpartation

Impact of low Population density: Population area outside downtown may not consider bike sharing as preferred source of transportation other than for leisure.  This will result in low volume of bike share demand from the local community.

## 3. Population Median Household Income

Des Moines, Iowa population has low median household income and the area is disperesed vs. New York specifically Manhattan where Bike Sharing is mostly prevelant.  

Impact of Low Median Household Income: Des Moines population may not have discretionary income to spend on sporty and recreational items like Bike.  Bike Sharing program may apply to mainly tourist who are there for outdoor activities.

Source: "How Much Does Your Cityâ€™s Bike Share Cost? The Aricle was based on data gathered  from local bike share programs in 65 cities nationwide to find out.

Impact to Bike Share Program: In Des Moines margins will be lower with the result break-even will be harder to achieve given utilization of bikes may be higher due to low density of Population.  Many people will be riding either in down-time or on the trails resulting in higher Utilization

## 5. High Competition from Existing Bike Share vendors

B-Cycle shop one of the main competitors in the area with over 20 stations and 120 bikes each station. Based on reseach, I saw 10 other Bike-share competition companies

Impact to Bike Share Program:  With low population of only 216K and low density and high competiton, it will be more expensive to obtain new customer.  This may require heavy discounting of program and negative cash flows

## 6. High Competition and Bike Sharing Pricing

Monthly & Annual Memberships - even though fee is minimal. However, each additional hour after 1 hour is at $2 per hour + Tax.  Though pricing structure looks attractive for investment.  Avg. Bike Sharing price for 8 hours was $6 per research.  This means Bike Sharing companies are heavily discounting thier prices to win market share.

# Conclusion: Soley based on Population, we propose to not invest in the bikesharing business.  

The scope of this analysis is limited since we are not accounting for visitors to the city that create high demand for the bike share program.  Also, we are not accounting for seasonal trends, demographics and other trends that require further research.
